fix list 1:

- [x] more Noise
- [ ] fix variance
- [ ] prefer euclidean over cosine
- [ ] cropped image view
- [ ] partial trails
- [ ] scrambled trails
- [ ] test set 20x per energy, less pendulums (maybe 100 ? if possible)

fix list 2: unfolding wish list
- [ ] maximum variance
- [ ] partially deep NN on output
- [ ] isomap, + correlation (spearman?)
- [ ] kernel regression???
- [ ] pca
- [ ] spectral embedding

wish list:
- [ ] "objective" battery of tests for noise resistance + partial data + interpolation + extrapolation
  - [ ] include more than one image creation method
- [ ] "objective" criterion for embedding (remember cosine exists too)
- [ ] code up all of these: (with optimal hyperparameters)
  - [x] infonce
  - [ ] simclr
  - [x] simsiam
  - [ ] byol
  - [ ] normie batch norm
  - [ ] decorrelated batch norm
  - [ ] barlow twins
  - [ ] (and maybe take a look at that vision transformer paper?)
