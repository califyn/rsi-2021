log:
read over the pytorch code (think i understand it 35%?)
found some links
skimmed https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033499 skipped the physics parts
looked over rumen and peter's slides/notes
got the environment to work, ran pendulum.py (epochs slow -_-)

questions:
-why 3 instead of 1 as in [learning conserved quantities using siamese](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033499 )
-what's a projector

what is temperature

read about cross entropy

supervised version

trajectory length adjustment

any 2 points

noise
